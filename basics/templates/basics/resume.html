<div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Person">
    <p>I am <span class="b" itemprop="name">Gergely Polonkai</span> (sometimes referred to as <span itemprop="nickname">W00d5t0ck</span> or <span itemprop="nickname">Polesz</span>), a <span class="b" itemprop="jobTitle">software developer, systems engineer and administrator</span>. I was born on <span class="b" itemprop="birthDate">7 March, 1983</span> in Budapest, Hungary. I spent my life moving here-and-there in the country, and finally settled in <span class="b" itemprop="address" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Address"><span itemprop="locality">Budapest</span></span>. Although I have already found my mate for life, I am <span class="b">single</span> yet (living in a common-law marriage), being the proud father of a son and a daughter.</p>
    <p>You can reach me on <span class="b" itemprop="email">gergely<span class="at-obfuscation"></span>polonkai.eu</span>, or by phone on <span class="b" itemprop="telephone">+36 (30) 7375-706</span>. I fluently speak and write <span class="b">English</span> and <span class="b">Hungarian</span>.</p>
    <p>I have <span class="b">graduated in 2001</span> from <span class="i">Táncsics Mihály Szakközépiskola, Szakiskola és Kollégium</span>, an architecture high school based in Veszprém, Hungary. There, I learned about <span class="b">electricity and elevators</span>, while getting my feet wet in the area of systems engineering. Together with some teachers, we developed <span class="b keyword" title="network building">the IT infrastructure of the school, building it from scratch</span> with <span class="b keyword">Windows XP</span> based clients, and <span class="b keyword">Debian GNU/Linux</span> servers with <span class="b keyword">Squid proxy</span>, an <span class="b keyword">Apache httpd</span> web server, <span class="b keyword">Exim</span>+<span class="b keyword">Courier IMAP</span> based internal mailing and a <span class="b keyword">Samba file server</span>. Meanwhile, I have created the school’s first <span class="b keyword" title="web development">web page</span> using <span class="b keyword">Perl CGI</span>, and it’s replacement later in <span class="b keyword">PHP</span>. Although I did that as a student, I consider it as my first job. You can contact <span class="b">Imre Pataki</span> on +36 (20) 970-5830 if you need more information.</p>
    <p>My first contract was made in <span class="b">2002</span> with <span class="b">GaTeS Group Kft.</span>, a Budapest based <span class="b">ISP</span> that served Internet connection to a large warren. I have mastered Linux based <span class="b keyword" title="firewalls">firewalling and routing</span> there using <span class="b keyword noupper">iptables</span>, and <span class="b keyword" title="QoS">tc for QoS</span>. I have also created a <span class="b">web page</span> for the company using <span class="b keyword">PHP</span> and <span class="b keyword" title="MySQL database development">MySQL</span>. My only contact for this company was Ákos Szabó, whose phone number is not reachable any more.</p>
    <p>After that, I contracted with <span class="b">Webvilág Kft.</span> in <span class="b">2004</span>. It was a <span class="b">web development company</span>, where I was in the role of both a <span class="b keyword" title="web development">web developer</span> and a <span class="b keyword" title="Systems administration">systems administrator</span>. I have mastered <span class="b keyword">PHP</span> there, together with <span class="b keyword">MySQL administration</span>. I also built a small <span class="b keyword" title="routers">router</span>/<span class="b keyword" title="firewalls">firewall</span> out of a PC for office needs. Althogh the company has changed its name to Fejlesztők Háza Kft., you may still contact <span class="b">Péter Bali</span> on +36 (70) 318-4050.</p>
    <p>My next job came in <span class="b">2006</span>, when I contracted with <span class="b">eWorldCom Kft.</span>, a small <span class="b">VoIP company</span>, developing call center software based on <span class="b keyword">Asterisk</span>. My job was to create a small base system for this software, while managing the old, Ubuntu based ones. For the new version, we targeted <span class="b keyword">Gentoo Linux</span> because of its possible small size, and performance reasons. The company since then fusioned with Virtual Call Center Kft. You may reach my ex-bosses (Tamás Jalsovszky and Szabolcs Tóth) there, altough I don’t know any of their new contacts.</p>
    <p>The job that followed was with <span class="b">Lufthansa Systems Hungary</span> in <span class="b">2007</span>, where I became the member of a large team supporting and administering several thousand servers, mostly based on <span class="b keyword">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</span> and <span class="b keyword">SUSE Enterprise Linux</span>. There I mastered cluster technologies (<span class="b keyword">Heartbeat 2</span> and <span class="b keyword">Red Hat Cluster</span>), <span class="b keyword">SAN</span>, <span class="b keyword noupper">iSCSI</span> and <span class="b keyword">NFS</span> based storages, <span class="b keyword">Apache httpd</span> and <span class="b keyword">Tomcat</span> web servers, administration of <span class="b keyword" title="MySQL administration">MySQL</span> and <span class="b keyword" title="Oracle 10g Database Administration">Oracle 10g Database</span>s, <span class="b keyword">Bacula</span> based backup, <span class="b keyword">Windows 2003 Server</span> and <span class="b keyword">Windows Server 2008</span> (both standalone and cluster) with <span class="b keyword">Active Directory</span>, <span class="b keyword">Group Policy</span>, <span class="b keyword">Microsoft Exchange Server 2005</span> and <span class="b keyword">Microsoft SQL Server 2005</span>, <span class="b keyword">Xen Open Source</span> virtualization, <span class="b keyword">Citrix XenServer</span> and <span class="b keyword" title="Citrix XenApp">XenApp</span>, <span class="b keyword">VMware ESXi</span> and <span class="b keyword" title="VMware vSphere">vSphere</span>, <span class="b keyword">Nagios</span> monitoring (and <span class="b keyword">monitoring</span> in general), and last, but not least, <span class="b keyword">Linux hardening</span> (<span class="b keyword">SELinux</span>, firewalls of different kinds, fighting <span class="b keyword">application security</span> issues). My boss was <span class="b">László Kiss-Kalló</span>, who can be reached on +36 (30) 429-9483.</p>
    <p>All this knowledge came in very handy, when I went to <span class="b">Brokernet Group Zrt.</span> in <span class="b">2010</span>. The IT infrastructure was in a very bad shape there, and our job was to rebuild most of it from scratch. We utilized <span class="b keyword">Debian GNU/Linux</span> servers (both standalone and <span class="b keyword">Heartbeat 2</span> clusters), <span class="b keyword">Apache httpd</span> web servers, <span class="b keyword">Exim</span>+<span class="b keyword">Courier IMAP</span> for mailing, <span class="b keyword">Bacula</span> based backup, <span class="b keyword" title="MySQL administration">MySQL</span> and <span class="b keyword" title="PostgreSQL administration">PostgreSQL</span> database servers, <span class="b">Oracle Database</span>s (both <span class="keyword" title="Oracle 10g Database Administration">10g</span> and <span class="keyword" title="Oracle 11g Database Administration">11g</span>), <span class="b">Microsoft SQL Server</span>s (both <span class="keyword" title="Microsoft SQL Server 2005">2005</span> and <span class="keyword" title="Microsoft SQL Server 2008">2008</span>), <span class="b keyword">Windows 2003 Server</span> and <span class="b keyword">Windows Server 2008</span> (both standalone and clusters), <span class="b keyword">Active Directory</span>, <span class="b keyword">Group Policy</span>, centralised <span class="b keyword">ESET NOD32 antivirus</span>, <span class="b keyword">Windows cluster</span> based <span class="b keyword" title="Microsoft File Server">file server with AD backend</span>, <span class="b keyword">WSUS</span>, <span class="b keyword">OTRS::ITSM</span> helpdesk, <span class="b keyword">Zabbix</span> based monitoring, virtualization with <span class="b keyword">Citrix XenServer</span>, IT security solutions with <span class="b keyword">SonicWall</span> appliances, <span class="b keyword">SELinux</span>, <span class="b keyword">Snort</span> and <span class="b keyword noupper">iptables</span>, <span class="b keyword">Perl</span> for system administration scripts, and <span class="b keyword">PHP</span> and the <span class="b keyword">Symfony 2</span> framework for internal web development. Although much has changed in this list since then, it was my best experience so far. You can contact <span class="b">Attila Balogh</span> on +36 (30) 924-8179.</p>
    <p>Since I left the company in <span class="b">2013</span>, I am working as a <span class="b">freelancer deloper</span> and a <span class="b">systems engeneer</span> for a <span class="b">startup network monitoring company</span>. Here we are building a help desk system using open source products like <span class="b keyword">OTRS::ITSM</span>, <span class="b keyword">OpenLDAP</span>, </p>
    <p>In my <span class="b">free time</span>, I wander in forests, take pictures, and sometimes manipulate them with the <span class="b keyword">GIMP</span>. Sometimes I write short novels using <span class="b keyword">LibreOffice</span>. I am also developing some software in <span class="b keyword">C</span>. When I’m not in the mood for writing, I go and check out the news on several technical areas, mostly IT and engineering, or give a try to a new programming language in the name of “why not?”. Currently I’m experimenting with Python.</p>
    <p>Although I don’t plan to change my workplace right now, when I do so, I look for firms that can develop my skills and give me financial stability through an interesting job.</p>
